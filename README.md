# Philly Soupkitchen Finder

This is a prototype of my Code for Philly food justice project, that's also the Rails Portfolio Project for my Flatiron School FulLStack Developer Program. The idea has a winding history, but this iteration comes from a conversation with an official at the DEpt of Public Health that went something like, "What I really need is a Yelp for soup kitchens and food pantries."

## Installation/Development
